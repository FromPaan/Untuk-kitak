Hey, i hope you doing well. And oh,u dont need to reply me if u dont want to. Sorry ngaco ktk. I try to find the right time and moment to chat you,but takut kmk x sempat nak sampaikan apa yg kmk mok pdh ngn ktk. I wish i can talk to you f2f, heart to heart. But yala, situasi x mengizinkan. So yea, actually for the past few week and till today, kmk x tenang and you keep pop out in my mind out of nowhere hahaha. I felt like i start to be the old me again when i finally get a chance to talk to you again. Not old me yg bodo2 ya. The old me that yg soft little boy ya,the one that keep waiting you until now. I already know what you go through,but yes i still need say what i need to for my side and i know my you on DND era i guess? So,all i want to say is, right now kmk di fasa yg i dont really know how to describe,but it more like menunggu. Kmk xmok ganggu ktk,xmok pressure ktk,still want you to go on with your life. I will just want to stay here,wait for you so i can make you happy again. And as for that,wanna be your old new home for you. I believe that god meet us once more semua ada sebab and this is it, tbh. I dont want you feel like what i say is bullshit,but xda sebab juak kmk nak bulak but yea,sepanjang kmk try nak move on dri ktk ra kuching tuk,selain belajar n ngembak dirik,i still failed to find the right person. Especially a type like you that have been stick with me for a years.(not physically) senang cita x jumpa type kedak ktk lah. Every person yg dengan kmk every time kmk gerek ra situk still ada part yg plh kmk teringat ktk. And i cant lie to myself and betul2 move on. The only day that i really decide to move on is the day ktk pkei baju ya,(don want to mention baju apa)  but now i got chance to be with you again and i really wish that i can do far better for you. So i have decided that,i will just stay here,waiting for you. I will only stop when u decide not to choose me for the rest of your life. Until that im just gonna wait for you,even it take another 5 year. Well,kmk penyabarkan hahaha. Or cyk pada takdir like u said to me 10 years ago. Shit lamak mena ya🤣 well i really believe god meet us again for this reason. anyway like i said, no pressure,keep go on with your life. If u need me,im always here. Berani utk kmk pdh,no more relationship until i find the right person,and hopefully u are the one that akan dtg and sit with me here. So yea, take care ktk. See you when i say you again. Or maybe raya? Hahaha idk. Depend on situation. Maybe when ktk ready to meet again then we meet. For now ill just wait and biarkan masa berlalu. Follow the flow. That all. Bye 18/3.
